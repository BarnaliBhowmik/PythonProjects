# Churn Survival and Analysis Prediction Model
1. Implemented a ML model to help businesses retain customers by identifying the risky ones.
2. Trained model on an existing dataset with key features such as Gender, CustomerID, MonthlyCharges, ContractType, & InternetService.
3. Working on building an interactive app/interface for business use, with future scope of scalability.

**RESULTS:**
1. **Logistic Regression:** *The accuracy score for the Logistic Regression model was 0.85.*
2. **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN):** *After hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV, the best KNN model achieved an accuracy score of 0.88.*
3. **Support Vector Classifier (SVC):** *After hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV, the best SVC model achieved the highest accuracy score of 0.885.*
4. **Decision Tree Classifier:** *After hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV, the best Decision Tree model had an accuracy score of 0.845.*
5. **Random Forest Classifier:** *After hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV, the Random Forest model had an accuracy score of 0.85.*
6. *The* **Support Vector Classifier (SVC)** *with the specified parameters (C: 0.01, kernel: 'linear') showed the highest accuracy among the models tested in this project.*
